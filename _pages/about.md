Hello! I'm Berkay, a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Genartive Adversarial Networks. I recently graduated from Marmara University, where I studied Computer Science and Engineering. I'm thrilled to share that I've been accepted into the Masters in Informatics program at Northeastern University, where I'll be continuing my academic journey.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on impactful projects that have allowed me to refine my skills. One notable experience involved collaborating with the Turkish Supreme Court, where I developed advanced models for tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Summarization, and Semantic Search. These projects aimed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of legal processes. Currently, I'm working as a dedicated Machine Learning Engineer, continuously seeking innovative solutions to complex problems. 

Outside of work, I enjoy being part of the vibrant community at the [BigDataLab](https://bigdatatextanalytics.org/people/) in Marmara University, engaging in collaborative discussions and exchanging insights. During my leisure time, I find intrigue in exploring the dynamics of the Stock Market, as it provides valuable insights into the global landscape.
