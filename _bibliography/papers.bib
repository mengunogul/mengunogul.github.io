  abstract={Discovering patterns is the process of understand- ing, while explainability refers to the ability to represent the discovered patterns in a way that the target audience can com- prehend. If we adapt the relevant proposition to explainability in law, jurists initially extract the essential components from a concrete case and then establish meaningful connections among these components to reach a conclusion. The second stage, where they explain how they reached the conclusion through the connections established between the components, is referred to as generating reasoning. This study focuses on the first stage of explainability, which involves extracting significant components and establishing basic-level connections with the conclusion. The proposed methodology presents an explainability approach that is independent of the model and can be applied to all classification problems. Furthermore, the best performance in the literature is achieved on the task of predicting the outcomes of Turkish Constitutional Court decisions.},

  abstract={In this study, a new method called Domain Classification and a natural language generator system in which this method is applied have been developed in order to increase the model performance in natural language processing studies conducted in the corpus of Turkish legal texts. In short, the new method developed states that the performance of a deep learning model trained in the field of law will be higher when it is trained on a sub-field based special dataset classified according to legal disciplines. To be able to test the method during the development process of the natural language generator is designed with an architecture using Recurrent Neural Networks, which can work as a hybrid, capable of being trained and working even on low-equipped devices by using interdisciplinary study. In addition, the texts produced in different fields of Turkish law by the natural language generator system developed in this study were examined, and it was discussed in which areas the developed Domain Classification method and the natural language generator could benefit the lawyers and the judicial system in general.},
